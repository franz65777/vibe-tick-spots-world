# üîê Complete Security Implementation Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Measures

### Database Security
- **Automatic Data Anonymization**: IP addresses, user agents, and session IDs are automatically anonymized before storage
- **Location Privacy**: User coordinates are automatically fuzzed with ¬±100m noise
- **Business Contact Protection**: Phone numbers and emails only accessible to users with legitimate business relationships
- **Message Privacy**: Direct messages protected with secure viewing functions
- **User Search Restrictions**: Profile data exposure limited to essential public information only
- **Automatic Data Cleanup**: Old sensitive data automatically deleted (analytics: 30 days, errors: 7 days, etc.)

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Profile Data**: Restricted access to sensitive user information
- **Business Profiles**: Contact information hidden from public view
- **Analytics Data**: Users can only access their own analytics
- **Messages**: End-to-end access control for private communications
- **Location Data**: User-specific location access controls

### Privacy-First Analytics

- **Session ID Protection**: Session identifiers hashed for privacy
- **Query Parameter Removal**: Sensitive URL parameters stripped
- **Browser Fingerprinting Reduction**: User agents simplified to browser family only

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Configuration Required

### Supabase Dashboard Configuration
**CRITICAL**: These settings must be configured manually in your Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Auth OTP Expiry** 
   - Go to: Authentication > Settings
   - Set OTP expiry to ‚â§ 3600 seconds (1 hour)
   - Link: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hrmklsvewmhpqixgyjmy/auth/providers

2. **Leaked Password Protection**
   - Go to: Authentication > Settings > Password Protection
   - Enable "Breach Password Protection"
   - Link: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hrmklsvewmhpqixgyjmy/auth/providers

### Additional Recommended Settings
3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Enable auth rate limiting in project settings
   - Set appropriate limits for your user base

4. **Email Domain Restrictions** (if needed)
   - Configure allowed email domains in Auth settings
   - Useful for business/internal applications
