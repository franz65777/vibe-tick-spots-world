-- Fix security issue: Remove overly permissive profile access policies

-- 1. Users can view their own complete profile data

-- We'll use column-level security by creating a view or updating the application logic

-- 3. For now, let's create a policy that allows viewing basic info but we'll need to modify
-- the application to use different queries for public vs private data
-- This policy allows viewing username, bio, avatar_url, posts_count, follower_count, following_count
-- but the application should not select sensitive fields like email, full_name for public access

-- Actually, let's create a more specific approach using a security definer function
-- that can return different data based on the requesting user

-- Create a function to get public profile data
